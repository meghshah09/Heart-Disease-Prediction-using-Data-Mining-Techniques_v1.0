% The following code example describes a function that returns the mean squared error for a given input of weights and biases,
% a network, its inputs and targets.

function mse_calc = mse_test(x, net, inputs, targets)
% 'x' contains the weights and biases vector
% in row vector form as passed to it by the
% genetic algorithm. This must be transposed
% when being set as the weights and biases
% vector for the network.
% To set the weights and biases vector to the
% one given as input
net = setwb(net, x');
% To evaluate the ouputs based on the given
% weights and biases vector
y = net(inputs);
% Calculating the mean squared error
mse_calc = sum((y-targets).^2)/length(y);
% end
% The following code example describes a script that sets up a basic Neural Network problem and the definition of a
% function handle to be passed to GA. It uses the above function to calculate the Mean Squared Error.

% INITIALIZE THE NEURAL NETWORK PROBLEM %
% inputs for the neural net
inputs = (1:10);
% targets for the neural net
targets = cos(inputs.^2);
% number of neurons
n = 2;
% create a neural network
net = feedforwardnet(n);
% configure the neural network for this dataset
net = configure(net, inputs, targets);
% create handle to the MSE_TEST function, that
% calculates MSE
h = @(x) mse_test(x, net, inputs, targets);
% Setting the Genetic Algorithms tolerance for
% minimum change in fitness function before

% PLEASE NOTE: For a feed-forward network
% with n neurons, 3n+1 quantities are required
% in the weights and biases column vector.
